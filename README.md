# Project Description

Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. Traditional diagnosis methods rely heavily on manual analysis of MRI scans by medical experts, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

This project leverages deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automatically detect the presence of brain tumors in MRI images. The goal is to provide a fast, reliable, and accurate method for tumor detection to support medical diagnosis.

Using a publicly available dataset of brain MRI scans labeled with tumor presence, the model is trained to distinguish between images with and without tumors. The system can be used as a standalone diagnostic tool or integrated into medical software for enhanced radiological analysis
